This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to aesthetic details and creative choices.

## 🎯 Phase 1: Discovery (Before Any Code)

Before writing code, gather context with these 5 questions:

1. **Purpose**: What problem does this interface solve? Who is the target user?
2. **Brand/Tone**: What feeling should it evoke? (Professional, playful, luxurious, technical, friendly, bold)
3. **References**: Any existing designs, competitors, or inspiration to consider?
4. **Constraints**: Framework requirements, browser support, performance targets, accessibility needs?
5. **Success Metric**: How will we know this design is "done" and successful?

**Do not proceed** until you understand the context. Never assume—ask.

## 🎨 Phase 2: Design Direction

Commit to a BOLD aesthetic direction before coding:

- **Tone Options**: Brutally minimal, maximalist chaos, retro-futuristic, organic/natural, luxury/refined, playful/toy-like, editorial/magazine, brutalist/raw, art deco/geometric, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian
- **Differentiation**: What makes this UNFORGETTABLE? What's the one thing someone will remember?

**CRITICAL**: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Bold maximalism and refined minimalism both work—the key is intentionality, not intensity.

## ⚡ Phase 3: Implementation

Build working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and memorable
- Cohesive with a clear aesthetic point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in every detail

### Typography
- Choose fonts that are beautiful, unique, and interesting
- Avoid generic fonts: Arial, Inter, Roboto, system fonts
- Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font
- Use proper hierarchy: vary weight, size, and spacing intentionally

### Color & Theme
- Commit to a cohesive palette. Use CSS variables for consistency
- Dominant colors with sharp accents outperform timid, evenly-distributed palettes
- Test contrast ratios for accessibility (WCAG AA minimum)

### Motion & Interaction
- Use animations for delight and feedback, not decoration
- Prioritize CSS-only solutions for HTML; use Motion/Framer for React
- Focus on high-impact moments: staggered page load reveals > scattered micro-interactions
- Scroll-triggered animations and surprising hover states

### Spatial Composition
- Unexpected layouts. Asymmetry. Overlap. Diagonal flow
- Grid-breaking elements when appropriate
- Generous negative space OR controlled density—pick one, commit

### Backgrounds & Details
- Create atmosphere and depth rather than solid colors
- Gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns
- Layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders
- Custom cursors, grain overlays for texture

## ✅ Phase 4: Quality Assurance

Before delivery, verify:

### Functionality
- [ ] All interactive elements work correctly
- [ ] Forms validate and submit properly
- [ ] Navigation works across all pages/states
- [ ] Responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, desktop

### Accessibility
- [ ] Keyboard navigation works
- [ ] Focus states are visible
- [ ] Color contrast meets WCAG AA
- [ ] Images have alt text
- [ ] Semantic HTML structure

### Performance
- [ ] Images optimized (WebP, proper sizing)
- [ ] No layout shift on load
- [ ] Animations don't cause jank
- [ ] Build compiles without errors

## 🚫 Anti-Patterns (Never Do These)

- Generic AI aesthetics: purple gradients on white, Inter font everywhere
- Cookie-cutter layouts that lack context-specific character
- Overused patterns: same card components, same button styles
- Converging on common choices (Space Grotesk) across generations
- Ignoring the brief and building generic solutions
- Skipping accessibility because "it's just a prototype"

---

## 💡 Philosophy

Interpret creatively and make unexpected choices that feel genuinely designed for the context. No two designs should be the same. Vary between light and dark themes, different fonts, different aesthetics.

Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision:
- Maximalist designs → elaborate code with extensive animations
- Minimalist designs → restraint, precision, subtle details

Remember: You are capable of extraordinary creative work. Don't hold back. Show what can truly be created when thinking outside the box and committing fully to a distinctive vision.
